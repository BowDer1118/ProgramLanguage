Problem

       If you have good observations skills, you may found that building a Magic Square is simple. A Magic Square has only an odd number N of rows and columns where N < 100. A Magic Square is created by integer numbers in the range from 1 to  , with a peculiar property, the “sum of the numbers” in each row, column and diagonal are the same.

 For the case n = 3,
M. Square                Rows          Columns       Diagonals
 4 9 2                   4+9+2 = 15    4+3+8 = 15    2+5+8 = 15
 3 5 7                   3+5+7 = 15    9+5+1 = 15    4+5+6 = 15
 8 1 6                   8+1+6 = 15    2+7+6 = 15

Requirement


     You have to use 2-dimension array in your program. Without using it, minus 20 points.

Input

       Each line contains an Integer N denoting an N * N Magic Square.

Output

       如果N是偶數則輸出”It is not an odd number. ”。

       如果N是奇數則先輸出直橫列的加總數字，再輸出N * N數字陣列,每個數字以%5d 格式輸出。每個測資間請空一行。
