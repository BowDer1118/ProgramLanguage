Problem Description

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer m and find the smallest integer n

such that m × n is a perfect square (x2). Hint: Store all smallest factors of m into an array

list. n is the product of the factors that appear an odd times in the array list. For example,

consider m = 90, store the factors 2, 3, 3, and 5 in an array list. 2 and 5 appear an odd number

of times in the array list. Thus, n = 5 × 2 = 10.
Input Format

There are many test cases, where each test case has one line containing a positive integer m.

(m <= 1000)
Output Format

Each test case prints out two integers n and m ∗ n
