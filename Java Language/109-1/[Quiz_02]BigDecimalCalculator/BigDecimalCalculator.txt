Problem Description

Write a program to input an expression in which the operands and operators are separated by

zero or more spaces. For example, 3.5+4 and 3.5+4 are acceptable expressions. The operators

in the expression might be +, -, *, /, and %. Your program must print out the expression and

its computing result. The sample output for the input expression 3.5 + 4 − 2.5 is shown below:

3.5 + 4.0 ‒2.1 = 5.4
Input Format

There are many input lines. Each line has an input expression Exp. Each expression can have

at most 3 operands and two operators.
Output Format

For each input expression Exp, please output the expression and its computing result. Output

each value with 1 decimal digit. Output tokens (operand and operator) are separated by a

space character.
Technical Specification
Write a static method BigDecimal calculate(String exp) to compute the expression

and return a BigDecimal result. The operands should be stored as BigDecimal in

this method. You have to use the arithmetic operators provided by the BigDecimal

class to calculate the expression
